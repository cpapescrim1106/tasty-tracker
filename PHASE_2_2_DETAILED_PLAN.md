- **Management action history** and audit trail

#### 3.2 Real-time Rule Engine
**File**: `workflow_position_monitor.py` (new)
- **Continuous position evaluation** against management rules
- **Automated rule execution** with configurable delays
- **Risk breach detection** and emergency closure triggers
- **Performance tracking** for rule effectiveness

#### 3.3 Enhanced Monitoring Integration
**Files**: `workflow_orchestrator.py` (enhancement)
- **Live position data integration** from existing delta tracking
- **Real-time P&L calculation** with Greeks
- **Time-based rule evaluation** (DTE monitoring)
- **Portfolio-level risk monitoring**

### Priority 4: Workflow Status Monitoring (Week 4)
**Objective**: Complete visibility into workflow progression and system health

#### 4.1 Workflow Status Dashboard
**File**: `static/js/workflow-status.js`, `static/css/workflow-status.css`
- **Live workflow state visualization** with progress indicators
- **System health metrics** (processing rates, error counts)
- **Workflow performance analytics** (success rates, average times)
- **Historical workflow data** with filtering and search

#### 4.2 Enhanced Workflow Orchestrator
**File**: `workflow_orchestrator.py` (enhancement)
- **Detailed state transition logging** with timestamps
- **Performance metrics collection** for analytics
- **Error categorization** and automatic recovery
- **Configurable processing parameters** via UI

#### 4.3 Integration Testing & Optimization
**Files**: Various
- **End-to-end workflow testing** from symbol scan to position closure
- **Performance optimization** for high-volume processing
- **Error handling robustness** testing
- **User acceptance testing** with real market data
